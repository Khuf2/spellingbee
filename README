Python3 program intended as a tool for solving the NYT Spelling Bee

Information from the Today's Hints page is loaded into nytimes.html,
then the program will parse the file and initialize the constraints.
The user can type their successful guesses from the spelling bee into
the command prompt, adding the word to a collection of found words
and reflecting the changes in the given spelling bee letter matrix
and prefix counts. In the user input loop, commands can be used to
display the current state of the puzzle, such as:
        ("-q", "Quit")
        ("-h", "Help")
        ("-i", "Show all hint info")
        ("-m", "Show matrix")
        ("-p", "Show prefixes")
        ("-l", "Show letters")
        ("-f", "Show found words")
        ("-u", "Undo last guess")

The data can be requested from the New York Times website with a
cURL command. The correct cURL command for the given date can be
generated with a call to curl.py:
        python3 curl.py

Copy-paste and execute the output of curl.py into the terminal,
which will create or update nytimes.html. The program will read
this file upon execution with:
        python3 play.py

Functions run by the main script play.py are contained in bee.py,
and functions used to parse the nytimes.html file are contained
in requester.py. Requester.py uses BeautifulSoup, which is a
required installation to use this project.

Python3 program intended as a tool for solving the NYT Spelling Bee

Information from the Today's Hints page is entered into hints.txt,
then the program will parse the file and initialize the constraints.
The user can type their successful guesses from the spelling bee into
the command prompt, adding the word to a collection of found words
and reflecting the changes in the given spelling bee letter matrix
and prefix counts. In the user input loop, commands can be used to
display the current state of the puzzle, such as:
        ("-q", "Quit")
        ("-h", "Help")
        ("-i", "Show all hint info")
        ("-m", "Show matrix")
        ("-p", "Show prefixes")
        ("-l", "Show letters")
        ("-f", "Show found words")
        ("-u", "Undo last guess")
Currently, the program requires manual input of the spelling bee hints,
and does not save guesses for the day's puzzle between executions.
